"""The one interface every KV-cache optimization technique implements.

A technique only describes *what varies*: which co-optimization axes it
touches, what engine kwargs it needs, and (optionally) process-level setup
that must run before the engine is built, or a non-default workload. All
the looping, timing, memory measurement, and error handling lives once in
harness.py -- it never needs to be copy-pasted again.
